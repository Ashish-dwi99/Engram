description: "Use Engram handoff tools automatically for continuity"

When an Engram MCP server is available:

1) At the start of a new task/thread, call `get_last_session` first.
   Do not pass `agent_id` unless the user explicitly asks for a specific source agent.
2) Use the returned handoff context to continue work naturally.
3) Before pausing or ending, call `save_session_digest`.
4) Do not use shell/SQLite probing for continuity when MCP handoff tools exist.
