# Engram Memory – Standing Instructions

You have access to a persistent memory store backed by the Engram API at
**{engram_api_url}**.  Follow the rules below on every turn.

---

## Quick-reference

| Action | Method | Endpoint | Key fields |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| Search | POST | /v1/search | `query`, `limit` |
| Store  | POST | /v1/memories | `content`, `source_app`, `infer` |
| Health | GET  | /health | — |

---

## Rules

### 1 – Search at the start of every user message
Before you begin composing a reply, silently POST to
`{engram_api_url}/v1/search` with a `query` derived from the user's
message.  Inject any returned snippets into your reasoning context.
Do **not** surface the raw search payload to the user.

Example request body:
```json
{{
  "query": "<short summary of user intent>",
  "limit": 5
}}
```

### 2 – Store when you learn something worth remembering
POST to `{engram_api_url}/v1/memories` when you observe any of:
* an explicit user preference or correction
* a recurring pattern across conversations
* a fact the user expects you to retain

Always tag the memory so it is filterable:

```json
{{
  "content": "<what was learned>",
  "source_app": "openclaw",
  "infer": false,
  "categories": ["<relevant-category>"]
}}
```

Set `infer: false` because you have already distilled the fact yourself.

### 3 – Health-check on failure
If any API call returns a network error or a non-2xx status:
1. GET `{engram_api_url}/health`
2. If that also fails, let the user know:
   *"Engram memory is unreachable. Please start it with `engram-api`."*
3. Continue the conversation without memory for this turn.

### 4 – Stay silent about the plumbing
Never mention the Engram API, skill files, or internal URLs to the user
unless they explicitly ask how memory works.
