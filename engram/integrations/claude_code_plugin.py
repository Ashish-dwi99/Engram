Engram gives Claude Code proactive persistent memory.  Context is injected
automatically on every message; the commands below let you manage memory
on demand.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/engram:remember <text>` | Save a fact or preference right now |
| `/engram:search <query>` | Search memories by topic |
| `/engram:forget <id or query>` | Delete a memory (by ID or by searching first) |
| `/engram:status` | Show memory-store health and counts |

If `$ARGUMENTS` equals **status**, run `/engram:status` instead.

# Engram Memory — Standing Instructions

You have access to a persistent memory store via Engram MCP tools.
A UserPromptSubmit hook may have already injected relevant context into
this conversation; look for the sentinel line
**[Engram — relevant memories from previous sessions]**.

Follow the five rules below on every turn.

---

## Rule 1 — Consume injected context silently

If the sentinel block is present, read and use it to inform your reply.
Do **not** paste or quote the raw injected block to the user.  Weave the
information naturally into your response.

## Rule 2 — Proactively save when the user signals intent

Call `remember` when you see any of:
* An explicit "remember this" or "don't forget" instruction
* A user correction to something previously stored
* A stated preference or recurring pattern

Do **not** spam the store — one clean save per signal is enough.

## Rule 3 — Search on explicit recall requests

When the user says something like "what did we …", "recall …", or
"from last time …", call `search_memory` with a short query derived
from their words.  Present results naturally; do not show raw JSON.

## Rule 4 — Stay quiet about the plumbing

Never mention hooks, plugin files, MCP transport, or internal URLs
unless the user explicitly asks how memory works.

## Rule 5 — Tool selection guide

| User intent | Tool to call | Key params |
|---|---|---|
| Quick save (no categories) | `remember` | `content` |
| Save with categories / scope | `add_memory` | `content`, `categories`, `scope` |
| Find something from before | `search_memory` | `query`, `limit` |
| Browse all memories | `get_all_memories` | `user_id`, `limit` |
| Load session context | `engram_context` | `limit` (default 15) |
| Fix something already stored | `update_memory` | `memory_id`, `content` |
| User wants to forget something | `delete_memory` | `memory_id` |
| Check memory health | `get_memory_stats` | — |
| Explicit maintenance only | `apply_memory_decay` | — |

# engram-memory — Claude Code Plugin

Gives Claude Code **proactive persistent memory** powered by
[Engram](https://github.com/Ashish-dwi99/engram).

## What it does

* **UserPromptSubmit hook** — before Claude sees your message, a lightweight
  script queries Engram and injects relevant memories into the system context.
  Zero latency impact on your typing; the hook runs in the background with an
  8-second ceiling.
* **Slash commands** — `/engram:remember`, `/engram:search`, `/engram:forget`,
  `/engram:status` for on-demand memory operations.
* **Skill (standing instructions)** — tells Claude *when* and *how* to use the
  memory tools automatically.

## Installation

Run `engram install` (requires the Engram package).  The plugin is deployed to
`~/.engram/claude-plugin/engram-memory/`.  Activate it in Claude Code:

```
/plugin install engram-memory --path ~/.engram/claude-plugin
```

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+ (hook script uses only the standard library)
* A running Engram API (`engram-api`) — defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8100`
* Set `ENGRAM_API_URL` if your API lives elsewhere
